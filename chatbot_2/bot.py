# A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended.

# modern web apps use a technique named routing. This helps the user remember the URLs. For instance, instead of having /booking.php they see
# /booking/. Instead of /account.asp?id=1234/ theyâ€™d see /account/1234/. Routes in Flask are mapped to Python functions: @app.route("/") is 
# a Python decorator that Flask provides to assign URLs in our app to functions easily. It's easy to understand what is happening at first 
# glance: the decorator is telling our @app that whenever a user visits our app domain at the given .route(), execute the home() function
@app.route("/")

# Flask has different decorators to handle http requests. Different methods for retrieving data from a specified URL are defined in this protocol.
# the http method GET the most common method. A GET message is send, and the server returns data

	# have as many elements as needed.
